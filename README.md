With an increase in population, there is an increase in the number of accidents that happen every minute. These road accidents are unpredictable. There are situations where most of the accidents could not be reported properly to nearby ambulances on time. In most of the cases, there is the unavailability of emergency services which lack in providing the first aid and timely service which can lead to loss of life by some minutes. Hence, there is a need to develop a system that caters to all these problems and can effectively function to overcome the delay time caused by the medical vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework using IoT, which helps in detecting car accidents and notifying them immediately. This can be achieved by integrating smart sensors with a microcontroller within the car that can trigger at the time of an accident. The other modules like GPS and GSM are integrated with the system to obtain the location coordinates of the accidents and sending it website and nearby ambulance to notify them about the accident to obtain immediate help at the location.
